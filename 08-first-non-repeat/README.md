## Problem

This is a semi-famous string problem that is pretty fun to solve.

Given a string of characters without spaces like the following:

```md
aaaccceeef
```

Write a function that returns the first non-repeating character. In this case, the correct answer would be `f`, since it is the first character in the string that doesn't have a repeat.

## Notes

- You will always have at least 1 character in the string
- Characters will only consist of alphanumeric characters, A-Z, 0-9
