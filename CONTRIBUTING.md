# Contribution Guide

This will explain the steps for proposing new solutions and reporting typos or other issues.

## Proposing a solution

To propose a solution to an existing problem, please fork the repo and create a PR using the [Solution Template](https://github.com/shin10kudev/weekend-code-challenge/blob/master/SOLUTION_TEMPLATE.md)

Insert your solution at the end of the `SOLUTION.md` file in a section titled `## Other soluions`. Please create this heading if it doesn't already exist.

### Tips

- Check your spelling and grammar
- For consistency, try to match function and input names from other solutions in the same problem (e.g. if an argument is called `numbers`, use `numbers` in your function as well)

## Fixing issues or typos

All programmers are great bug catchers -- and copy editors, too! If you notice something you'd like to fix, please fork the rop and submit a PR using the provided [PR Template](https://github.com/shin10kudev/weekend-code-challenge/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

As an alternative, you can submit an issue using the [Issue Template](https://github.com/shin10kudev/weekend-code-challenge/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

## Note on submissions

Weekend code challenge is a curated list of problems and solutions with the goal of teaching useful techniques and problem solving skills to the larger programming community.

I reserve the right to modify your submitted solutions for spelling and grammatical fixes, and to change the provided descriptions and solutions in any way to better highlight key points, make the syntax and voice consistent with other solutions, or to change and or remove submitted solutions at any time without notice.
